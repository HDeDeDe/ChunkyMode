## Installation
To install with r2modman automatically, either click the "Install with Mod Manager" button at the top of the page on [Thunderstore](https://thunderstore.io/package/HDeDeDe/ChunkyMode/) or search for ChunkyMode within r2modman.

To install manually, either click the "Manual Download" button at the top of the page on [Thunderstore](https://thunderstore.io/package/HDeDeDe/ChunkyMode/), or download the latest release from [GitHub](https://github.com/HDeDeDe/ChunkyMode/releases). Once downloaded, if you are using r2modman, launch r2modman and navigate to your preferred Risk of Rain 2 profile. From there, go to Settings > Profile > Import local mod, and then select `HDeDeDe-ChunkyMode-{Version_Number}.zip` (or just `ChunkyMode.zip`) when prompted. Confirm the settings and you should be good to go.

If you do not have r2modman, then make sure you have the required dependencies (they can be found at the top of the page on [Thunderstore](https://thunderstore.io/package/HDeDeDe/ChunkyMode/)), navigate to your Risk of Rain 2 install folder > BepInEx > plugins and extract the following files from `ChunkyMode.zip` to the same subfolder: `ChunkyMode.dll, chunkydifficon, ChunkyMode.language, ChunkyMode.pdb`
